## Inspiration
Our project was inspired by the recent spike in popularity of the game Wordle. We wanted to create a fun way to learn about Black historical figures who often are not talked about enough. 

## Black History Month Wordle
Play your favorite word game and learn in the process!

## Instructions
When the game begins, the player must enter a guess. After this guess, they are able to choose between having a letter revealed to them, or guessing again. They will be prompted to continue doing this until they are out of points, or have guessed the word. 

## Challenges
The main challenge we ran into was just debugging. For a while, our program almost worked, but not quite. After making little tweaks we were able to solve this. Another challenge of our project was deciding which historical figures we wanted to write about and how we would ensure each day was different. In order to fix this, we web scraped from a website (pb-resources.com) that automatically updates the page to show a new historical figure every day. During the web scraping process, we ran into trouble because the data was dynamic rather than static, leading us to use the API selenium rather than just beautiful-soup.

## Accomplishments
An accomplishment we are proud of is just finishing our game with a working implementation. We are excited to play each day and learn about historical figures.

## What's next for Black History Month Wordle? 
Being able to make the game interactive and having a user interface would be the next step for our project.
